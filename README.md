Android front-end for the project presented in the 2015 edition of http://www.sciencehackdayeindhoven.nl/. The idea was to have smart-bin collectors for garbage.
The Android app scans a product, sends a signal to the bin control center (an Arduino in our case) and the right bin where the product can be tossed is open.
